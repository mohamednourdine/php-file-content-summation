# Php File Content Summation

A production-ready function in PHP that sums the numbers in a file and outputs details of the results. The function will receive as input the path to a single file. Each line of the file will contain either a number or a relative path to another file. For each file processed, output the file path and the sum of all of the numbers contained both directly in the file and in any of the sub files listed in the file (and their sub files, etc)
